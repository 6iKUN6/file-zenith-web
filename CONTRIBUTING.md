# Contributing Guide

Thank you very much for your interest in contributing to this project! To make the contribution process as smooth as possible, please follow the guidelines below.

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

First, fork the repository to your GitHub account. This will create your own copy of the repository.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository you just forked to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-zenith-web.git
cd file-zenith-web
```

### 3. Add Upstream Remote

To keep your repository in sync with the original repository, add the upstream remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/code-cracks/file-zenith-web.git
```

### 4. Create a New Branch

Before you start working, make sure to create a new branch. Branch names should follow the "functionality type/functionality description" format:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/feature-description
```

Branch types can be:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Styling
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Testing
- `chore`: Other changes

For example: `feat/home`, `fix/login-bug`, `docs/api-guide`

## Development Workflow

### 1. Install Dependencies

Before you start developing, install all dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```
